# Changelog

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-27
### Added
- **Declarative GitOps Deployment:** Standardized `deploy/k8s/` base and environment overlays (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) adhering to CNCF restricted pod security standards (non-root UID 10001, dropped capabilities, read-only rootfs).
- **ArgoCD Continuous Delivery:** Added declarative ArgoCD application manifests (`deploy/argocd/application.yaml`, `application-dev.yaml`, `application-prod.yaml`, `values-override.yaml`).
- **Multi-Cluster Orchestration:** Integrated with `multi-cluster-gitops-promotion` catalog for automated zero-drift self-healing in development/staging and gated PR promotion in production.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-20
### Added
- **Progressive Credential Loading (PCL):** Dynamic auto-promotion between zero-dependency mock fallbacks and live production backends based on environment credentials.
- **Dual Distribution:** Universal OCI container publishing to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/sumitdalavi/distributed-job-scheduler`) and Helm OCI registries alongside GitHub Release tarballs.
- **Health Reporting:** Exposed `/health` or `/healthz` endpoint with PCL status detection (`mock` vs `live`).
- **Dynamic Reloading:** Support for atomic ConfigMap / secret reloads without requiring pod restarts.
- **Supply Chain Security:** Trivy vulnerability scan gates and SPDX JSON SBOM (`sbom.spdx.json`) generation for all releases.
- **Compose Profile Orchestration & CI Realignment:** Added multi-profile support (`profiles: ["live"]`) for PostgreSQL container and updated CI benchmark harness with `--profile live` execution.
